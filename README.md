Bumpbook is a responsive, desktop app for expectant mothers.

It provides users with a single-page, user-friendly dashboard to store and view key information throughout their pregnancy journey.

### `npm install`

2. Set up a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database running on your local machine.

3. Create a .env file in the server folder with the relevant information.

Please see the .env.example.md file for an explanation of the required information.

## Available Scripts

In the CLIENT directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This will run the app client. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

In the SERVER directory, you can run:

### `nodemon index.js`

This will run the back-end server which will reload when you make changes.

## Usage
