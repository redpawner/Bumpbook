### Available Scripts

In the <strong>CLIENT</strong> directory, you can run:

<h4><em>npm start</em></h4>

This will run the app client. Open [http://localhost:PORT](http://localhost:PORT) to view the app in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes in the client directory.

In the <strong>SERVER</strong> directory, you can run:

<h4><em>node index.js</em></h4>

This will run the back-end server. Alternatively you can use nodemon which will automatically reload the server when you make changes in the server directory e.g.

<h4><em>npx nodemon index.js</em></h4>

### Usage
