# BUMPBOOK


## Introduction


Bumpbook is a responsive, desktop app for expectant mothers.

It provides users with a single-page, user-friendly dashboard to store and view key information throughout their pregnancy journey.

Features include account login and registration with custom built authentication; a due date calculator; an interactive appointments list; a baby name generator API + baby name list; a useful links list that dynamically changes (using an NHS API) depending on how far along the user is in their pregnancy; and the ability to upload baby bump pictures in a scrollable view reel.
